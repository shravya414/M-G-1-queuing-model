This project explores a queuing system model for airport check-in counters, focusing on disturbances caused by overweight baggage.
Using MATLAB, we calculate the  expected waiting times and identifies delays caused by disturbances.
The findings reveal that disturbances increase waiting times, underscoring the need for improved efficiency in managing such scenarios.
